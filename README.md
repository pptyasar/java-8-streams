# Java 8 Streams Cookbook

A comprehensive cookbook of 200+ Java 8 Stream operations, tricks, and recipes, organized by category, with code samples and expected input/output. This guide covers intermediate, advanced, and most advanced stream usage, including arrays, collections, strings, custom objects, grouping, reduction, parallelism, and more.

## Usage

Each section contains ready-to-use Java methods, formatted for direct copy-paste into your codebase. All methods are compatible with Java 8+. For each, you’ll find:

- Method signature and implementation.
- Commented sample input and output.
- When relevant, sample usage with custom classes (e.g., `Employee`).

## Example

Here’s a sample recipe from the cookbook:

```java
// Find all even numbers in a list
public static List<Integer> findEvenNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
    return numbers.stream()
            .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
// Sample:
List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
System.out.println(findEvenNumbers(nums)); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

---

## Getting Started

1. Browse the section you need from the list above.
2. Copy any method and its sample into your code.
3. Adapt parameter types or output formats as needed.
4. For custom object recipes, ensure you have the relevant POJO (e.g., `Employee`).
